## About

I build production-grade systems - from database architecture to deployment. Four years of hands-on engineering, four large-scale external platforms delivered as a sole developer inside an early-stage startup.

My work spans backend architecture, role-based access control, large-scale data handling, and cloud infrastructure. I operate at the intersection of engineering rigor and product delivery, collaborating directly with stakeholders to ship systems that serve real users at scale.

Certified in Cyber Warfare (Israel Cyber Campus, 2025). Security is not an afterthought in my stack - it is built in from day one.

## Experience Highlights

**Sole Full-Stack Developer**

- Architected and delivered 4 large-scale client-facing platforms end-to-end, from system design through production deployment
- Designed scalable Firestore database schemas to handle high-volume, structured data across multiple concurrent platforms
- Built modular backend systems with granular, role-based permission logic governing access across complex user hierarchies
- Engineered event-driven Discord automation systems capable of handling asynchronous, high-throughput workloads
- Applied production-level security practices across all surfaces: authentication flows, API exposure, data validation, and transport security
- Integrated a range of cloud services and third-party APIs into cohesive, maintainable backend architectures
- Collaborated with product and design stakeholders to translate requirements into reliable, scalable technical implementations

## Architecture & Backend Philosophy

I approach backend systems as infrastructure problems first. Before writing a line of code, I define the data model, the access patterns, and the security surface. The result is systems that are maintainable under pressure, extensible without rewrites, and secure by default - not by retrofit.

Core principles I apply consistently:
- **Schema-first design** - data architecture drives every downstream decision
- **Least-privilege access** - role-based controls scoped tightly at every layer
- **Defensive engineering** - validation, sanitization, and rate limiting at all system boundaries
- **Separation of concerns** - modular service layers that isolate logic and reduce coupling
- **Deployment readiness** - Docker, NGINX, and cloud-native configuration handled as part of development, not afterthought

## AI & Automation

I integrate AI capabilities into production workflows with precision. This is not surface-level API consumption - it is system-level design that treats AI as a reliable service component with defined inputs, outputs, and failure modes.

- Advanced prompt engineering with OpenAI and Gemini APIs embedded in live production systems
- WhatsApp Cloud API automation pipelines serving active users
- Discord automation with event-driven architecture and structured response flows
- AI-augmented backend workflows designed for reliability and observability
